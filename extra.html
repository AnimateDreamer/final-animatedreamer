            <p>I am a Taiwanese American with 2 brothers: one older and one who's 11 years younger. My birthday is December 8 and I’m a Sagittarius. I speak English and Mandarin Chinese. I am currently working at Downtown Disney retail as a merchandise hostess.
                I do freelance work on Fiverr and some independent work on my free time. My favorite food is prime rib, I like them rare and with horseradish. My favorite dessert is cheesecake and I like it plain or with whipped cream. I love to drink
                green tea and almond tea.
        </div>
        <div class="middle-section">
            <p>Besides working on art projects, I also love to watch Japanese anime, play video games, cooking, and exercising during my free time. My favorite anime is "Saber Marionette J” and my favorite character is Lime. I grew in the 90's and I love
                to watch a lot of Japanese anime and western cartoons such as “The Powerpuff Girls”. My artistic inspiration is deeply inspired by anime's exaggerated facial expressions and cartoon's fluent animation. My dream is to work at an animation
                studio for cartoon shows or to make independent animated short-films online. For video games, I love Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. My favorite series is "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker” because I love the cartoony artstyle
                and the enchanting story. I am currently playing "Animal Crossing: New Horizons” on the Nintendo switch. Other than art, I also enjoy cooking and baking desserts such as mug cake. This Thanksgiving, I attempted to roast prime rib in the
                oven for the first time in my life. The end result turned out successfully and my aunt said she will have me cook her one next time. Since quarantine, I have been doing HIIT workouts with my little brother to help us keep in shape and
                to build some muscles. In the past, my body got weak and tired easily from poor dieting and poor circulation. Now after working out for over half a month, I have gained two ab muscles and I don't feel as tired as before. My goal is to
                reach 125 pounds and maintain my body fat around 19%.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bottom-section">
            <p>The artists that motivated me to become a creator are Hayao Miyazaki, Craig McCracken, Lauren Faust and Richard Williams. I watched their animated films and cartoons since I was a child and it was through their creations that helped me to
                think and grow as a person. My favorite film from Miyazaki is “Spirited Away” because I watched that film when I first got transferred from Taiwan to America. It illustrated how scary and exciting being at an unfamiliar environment for
                a child. At that time, I was also feeling scared and curious about my new surroundings so this film help me deal with my culture shock. After I moved to the US, I started to watch American cartoon shows such as “Spongebob Squarepants”,
                “Dexter’s Laboratory”, and other classic 90’s cartoons. My favorite one during that time was “The PowerPuff Girls” because I saw it aired in Taiwan before so it was nice to see it in English here. I really liked the concept of little girls
                fighting crimes while going to school. After I entered my college year, I started watching the new “My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic” with Faust as its creative director and executive producer. I love the artistic style and individual
                stories for the Mane Six as well as the fluent flash animation. Then when I began to study animation as a career, I studied Richard Williams’ “The Animator’s Survival Kit” to practice some basic animation exercises. </p>
